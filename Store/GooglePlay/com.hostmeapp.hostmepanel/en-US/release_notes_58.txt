This is the major release that includes:
New reservation widget. We are introducing a brand new reservation widget that you can place on your website. Not only does it come with a new style and different orientation options, it collects more information about your guests, such as email, food preferences, allergy, event type and more. Read about all these improvements below.
Online reservation page for restaurant. Every restaurant in our system has a page with information about the restaurant and an online reservation form. Restaurants can add a link to this page to their website or to the restaurant's profile on Yelp, Google, TripAdvisor or any other business catalogs, to make it easy for visitors to book a table on-the-go.  
Reservation and Waitlist Dashboard Improvements. This release includes improvements and additions to the reservations and waitlist user interfaces. These improvements include a message center, reservation search, reservation list view and more. Read more about these updates below.
